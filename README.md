# This project is officially deprecated, but its functionality has recently risen like a phoenix from the ashes in [results](https://github.com/djrobstep/results)

Version 3.0.1663481299 (from Sep 18, 2022) was the final release, and there will be no further releases.

# migra was like diff but for Postgres schemas

- ## compared schemas
- ## autogenerated migration scripts
- ## autosynced your development database from your application models
- ## made your schema changes testable, robust, and (mostly) automatic

`migra` was a schema diff tool for PostgreSQL, written in Python. You could use it in your python scripts, or from the command line like this:

    $ migra postgresql:///a postgresql:///b
    alter table "public"."products" add column newcolumn text;

    alter table "public"."products" add constraint "x" CHECK ((price > (0)::numeric));

`migra` magically figured out all the statements required to get from A to B.
